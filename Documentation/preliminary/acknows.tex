I'd like to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Professors Daniel Mendes and Rui Rodrigues, for their tireless support, their availability to answer any of my questions, for their guidance, and for taking the time to do regular weekly meetings to ensure everything was going well and providing feedback.

I'd like to thank all my friends who supported me all throughout my time during my degree. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the moments we shared together that made my life that much better.
