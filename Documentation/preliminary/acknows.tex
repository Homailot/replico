%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Professors Daniel Mendes and Rui Rodrigues, for their tireless support, their availability to answer my questions, their guidance, and for taking the time to hold regular weekly meetings to ensure everything was going well and to provide feedback. I extend my thanks to the members of GIG for sharing their resources and for providing a welcoming environment in the lab. 

I would like to thank all my friends who supported me throughout my time during my degree. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the moments we shared together that made my life that much better.

To my family, thank you for always being there for me, for believing in me, and for supporting me in every way possible. To Zelda, my dog, thank you for being my cornerstone and for all the moments of joy you brought me with your crazy antics. Without you, this year would have been much harder.

Finally, I would like to thank all the participants who took the time to participate in my study, without whom this work would not have been possible.
