\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}

Throughout human history, collaboration has been an integral part of our pursuit of knowledge. Effective communication and a deep comprehension of each other have propelled us to advance our understanding and technological progress. In the digital age, it is only natural to harness the power of technology to extend collaboration to the digital realm, connecting people around the world. This is particularly pertinent in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has underscored the importance of digital tools in facilitating collaboration.

Virtual Reality (VR) emerges as a compelling platform for collaboration, offering a heightened sense of presence and immersion that inherently enhances social capabilities. A noteworthy subset of VR is DeskVR, immersing users in a virtual environment using a stereoscopic head-mounted display (HMD), all while comfortably seated at an office desk. DeskVR presents unique opportunities for interactions with the virtual environment, focusing on enhancing comfort, reducing physical fatigue, and improving accessibility to VR.

\section{Context and Motivation}

The transition of real-world collaborative tasks to the digital realm demands careful consideration and a thorough understanding of how we communicate. Often, certain tasks become more challenging in the digital space, leading users to prefer and be more efficient in performing those tasks in the real world. During this transition, social information tends to become opaque, limiting users' understanding of each other \cite{ericksonSocialTranslucenceApproach2000}.

VR is an excellent medium for collaboration since users can coexist in a virtual space, visually observing each other's actions and communicating through voice. Still, designing for awareness in VR presents some challenges, particularly with interfaces and information presentation. For example, reading text can be difficult in VR \cite{rauSpeedReadingVirtual2018, kimUserDiscomfortUsing2021}. Nonetheless, advancements in resolution and HMD technology, such as eye gaze tracking, are addressing this issue.

Using VR while standing and relying on mid-air interaction for extended periods can induce fatigue and may be less accessible for individuals with mobility impairments. DeskVR addresses this concern, allowing users to interact with the environment while seated. The use of an office desk offers additional benefits, serving as a surface for touch-based approaches, providing passive haptic feedback, and serving as a virtual representation for presenting social information or operational instructions \cite{zielaskoMenusDeskSystem2019, sousaVRRRRoomVirtualReality2017}. However, constraining users to a seated position limits their movement, requiring special attention while designing for DeskVR.

For instance, one of the most common interactions in VR is object manipulation, which often relies on techniques designed for users who are standing and engaging in physically demanding mid-air movements. Given that DeskVR users are confined to a desk, their mobility and range for mid-air movements are limited. Therefore, it is important to design object interaction techniques considering range, physical demand, and ergonomics for seated users \cite{almeidaSIT6IndirectTouchbased2023}.

Collaboration can be used to help object manipulation. For example, handling large objects in VR is difficult as they may obscure the user's view during positioning tasks, often requiring users to place and inspect the object from alternative angles \cite{bowmanEvaluationTechniquesGrabbing1997}. A collaboration involving multiple users can be advantageous in these situations, as diverse viewpoints contribute to a better understanding of the environment, assisting the primary user in successfully manipulating the object \cite{pinhoCooperativeObjectManipulation2008}. The challenge lies in seamlessly integrating efficient collaboration and social awareness within the limitations of DeskVR.

\section{Objectives}

The goal of this work is to design and implement a collaborative framework for VR that seamlessly integrates efficient collaboration and awareness within DeskVR. This will involve a comprehensive examination of the current state-of-the-art techniques in collaboration, computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), and DeskVR. The objective was to discern the difficulties and challenges inherent in these areas, hoping to identify a promising avenue for exploring collaboration. Subsequently, this framework will undergo user evaluation to analyze its effectiveness as a tool for communication and cooperation.
